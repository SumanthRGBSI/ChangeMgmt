# UI/UX Debugging and Fixing Plan

## 1. Initial Assessment
- [x] Clone repository and examine structure
- [x] Review package.json - Found: Basic setup, no UI framework dependencies
- [x] Review HTML structure - Found: Basic HTML with Tailwind CSS and vanilla JS
- [x] Review CSS - Found: Tailwind CSS v4.1.16 compiled styles
- [x] Review JavaScript - Found: Vanilla JS with custom component system

## 2. Identify Core Issues
- [x] Check for missing Tailwind CSS configuration - Found: Tailwind CSS is present
- [x] **CRITICAL FIX: Fixed JavaScript syntax error (line 895: }} to ;)**
- [ ] Verify color scheme/theme implementation
- [ ] Test modal/popup functionality
- [ ] Test slider/carousel functionality
- [ ] Check interactive element bindings
- [ ] Identify missing dependencies

## 3. Root Cause Analysis
- [x] **PRIMARY ISSUE: JavaScript syntax error preventing execution**
- [ ] Examine theme/color scheme implementation

- [ ] Verify color scheme is now working
- [ ] Test modal/popup functionality
- [ ] Check for any remaining issues

## 5. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test all fixed components
- [ ] Verify responsive design
- [ ] Check cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] Document all changes made

## 6. Deliverables
- [ ] Create comprehensive issue report
- [ ] Provide step-by-step fix documentation
- [ ] Share corrected code snippets
- [ ] Recommend testing procedures
